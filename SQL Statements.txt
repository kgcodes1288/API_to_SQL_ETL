Provide query/analysis to give biggest earthquake of 2017

Provide query/analysis to give most probable hour of the day for the earthquakes bucketed
by the range of magnitude (0-1,1-2,2-3,3-4,4-5,5-6,>6
For border values in the bucket, include them in the bucket where the value is a lower limit so for 1 include it in 1-2 bucket)
